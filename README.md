# Programming-3
This code is only for reference. Try doing the problems by yourself first, and if you get stuck try to understand the code without just copying(I will comment on the code as much as possible, so it is easy to understand). If you have no other choice, don't just copy the code as it is, make changes in `variables`, `code-structure` , `for-while loops`, `comments`. If you just copy, it's your responsibility to be creative enough not to get caught for plagiarism. 
## Important
I will be uploading all answers to this repo on take home Assignments and Tutes as soon as possible 
## If something is wrong
Start a `New issue`. If you can fix it, fix it and open a `New pull request`.
